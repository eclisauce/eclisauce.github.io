          <h2><u>About</u></h2>
          <p>"The Reckless" was established in October 2011 as a leading PvE guild based at Terenas EU and has transferred to Twisting Nether EU in June 2015. We are an English speaking guild with players from many EMEA countries.</p>
          <p>Our aim is to be competitive and efficient in every raiding tier as we have been since early 4.2 days. What we lack in terms of time investment, we make up with great efficiency, teamwork and skills. Above all else, we value maturity, stability and loyalty.</p>
          <h3>Raiding schedule</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Our current raid nights (which are subject to change) are:</li>
            <li>Wednesdays (Heroic/Mythic): 20:00 - 00:00</li>
            <li>Thursdays (Mythic): 20:00 - 00:00</li>
            <li>Mondays (Mythic): 20:00 - 00:00</li>

          <h3>RECRUITMENT & EXPECTATIONS</h3>
          <p>Starting in Antorus we will be doing some heroic splits so if you have a alt that is good to go that would be good</p>
          <p>You can check the specific classes/specs we are currently recruiting on wowprogress but also keep in mind that we are always in search of exceptionally skilled, mature players to join our ranks. Mature players being the keyword, we DO NOT tolerate loot, standby or any other type of guild drama, or/and dps/meter whoring. We also have a 18+ age policy.</p>
          <p>What we expect from the applicants is to be able to learn the boss fights and our strategies, having a very good knowledge of the fight mechanics for each difficulty. The applicants also have to know their classes in and out, always keeping their knowledge up-to-date for their latest class changes. Being able to play multiple specs and toons at high level is a big bonus.</p>
          <p>We also expect trialists to signup and be ready to attend every Mythic Raid as humanly possible. We have a strong, compact team with very high attendance rate (90%) requirements for our progression raids. If you are planning to apply to us, you need to be able to meet those requirements.</p>
          <p>If you are interested, please feel free to make an application by following the button bellow, or alternatively catch either of us for a chat: Herlios / Galdir / Ecl√≠. More contact info bellow</p>
